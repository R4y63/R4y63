# What’s up, fellow cyber wanderer? 👾

I’m **R4y63** — codename, because calling me by my real name sounds too boring 😎  
A **Cybersecurity Enthusiast** on a mission to break stuff (ethically, of course) and then figure out how to stop the bad guys from doing the same.

I started off digging through digital breadcrumbs in Forensics, but now I’m all about offensive moves — hacking with a purpose and learning every day.  
This page is my playground, my lab notes, and my battle scars all rolled into one.
